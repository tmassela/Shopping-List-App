Motivation:  
------------
This is a useful application that can be used on the go to quickly create lists saving on the endless piles of paper lists sitting around a kitchen or office.  This app was created with the Javascript library, jQuery, and minimal CSS.  This interactive web app is a grocery list in which the user can add items, delete items or cross items off.  Key concepts:  event listeners, DOM traversal and manipulation, a11y considerations.
